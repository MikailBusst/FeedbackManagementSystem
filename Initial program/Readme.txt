There 4 source codes available in our system. 
The CountVector_Step_By_Step_Implementation.ipynb and TFIDF_Step_By_Step_Implementation.ipynb are referene for the training and testing of the models. The configuration of the models such as hyperparameter tuning can be refer to these 2 files. (Note that currently these 2 file does not contain our main functionality of the system.)

The main function can be refer on Feedback_Sentiment_Analysis_System_Comparison.ipynb and main.py.
Feedback_Sentiment_Analysis_System_Comparison.ipynb contains analyzing each model and comparing model functions.

Main.py is used for prediction with an specific GUI.
